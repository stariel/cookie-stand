    <p class="text">Pat is a native of the Pacific Northwest who grew up in and around Seattle, appreciating the natural beauty and easy access to salmon and coffee. After having kids, Pat struggled to find a way for the whole family to enjoy the health benefits of salmon. With two young picky eaters, Pat attempted to hide salmon in various culinary concoctions, but to no avail.</p>
    <p class="text">One day in frustration, Pat tried pulverizing the salmon and baking it into cookies, and the ancestor of Pat's Salmon Cookies was born. These cookies were both delicious and nutritious - and best of all, the kids didn't even notice the salmon! Once the secret was out, the whole family kept eating the delicious cookies, and Pat started experimenting with different flavors.</p>
